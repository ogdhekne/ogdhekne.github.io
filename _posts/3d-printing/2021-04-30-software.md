A software application is required to make 3D printer functional device i.e. firmware.\
There are a few close-source and free and open source (FOSS) firmware providers available.\
What I have chosen is [Marlin Firmware].\
This firmware provides ability to customize firmware suitable to needs.\
I have forked [marlin's official source code] to [my github repos] and made modifications suitable to my needs and desire.


I am using two types of boards for 3D printer:
 - RAMPS 1.4 board with Arduino MEGA 2560:

 - Geeetech GT2560  rev A+:
