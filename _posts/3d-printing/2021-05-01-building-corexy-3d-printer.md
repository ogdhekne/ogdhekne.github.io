As an newbie creator I wanted to have a 3D printer using which I can print 3D objects and work on my creative work.

I did search and try to gain information on 3D printers to buy and as an informed person I wanted to buy 3D printer that could:
- Modular and support customization.
- Build size more than 200 mm x 200 mm x 200 mm
- Be cheaper by price.

And answer to this wish list is **NO**, I cannot get all three things at the same time.
Either I can get cheaper model with low build size dimensions  or expensive model with high build size.
Where modularity and customization support is common factor in all build sizes.

After many months of information search and thought I came to conclusion that I could build 3D printer, off course not without help of any kind.
So I started collecting information for my [ideal 3D printer](https://reprap.org/wiki/HyperCube).

Information about parts required, their quantity, price and place to buy in my city: (पुणे) Pune, Maharashtra, India
