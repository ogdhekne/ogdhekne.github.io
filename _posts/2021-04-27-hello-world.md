This is my first time to write jekyll blog.
I have written blogs before using:
1. write.io - hosting on oracle cloud instance, which obviously didn't workout. It did gave important feature ie. multi-blog hosting - that was awesome.
2. blogspot.com - did not like its appearence and management (web based editing)
3. ghost - on oracle cloud instance, it was good for brief period of time but lack many required features.
4. jekyll - this is hosted using gh-pages.

I am going to host many blog posts related to Linux / BSD sysadmin how to's, My trekking experience, My 3D printing and 3D printer building stuff and Scripting.

Let's see how it goes.
