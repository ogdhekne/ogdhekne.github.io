This is my first time to write jekyll blog.
I have written blogs before using:
1. write.io - hosting on oracle cloud instance, which obviously didn't workout. It did gave important feature ie. multi-blog hosting - that was awesome.
2. blogspot.com - did not like its appearence and management (web based editing)
3. ghost - on oracle cloud instance, it was good for brief period of time but lack many required features.
4. jekyll - this is hosted using gh-pages.

I am going to host many blog posts related to Linux / BSD sysadmin how to's, My trekking experience, My 3D printing and 3D printer building stuff and Scripting.

Let's see how it goes.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
